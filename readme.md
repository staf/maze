Maze generation I played with one evening.

Saved for future use in case of usage with some procedurally generated game using a maze like struture.

See [the new game repository](https://github.com/staf/maze-game) for the basic "game" implementation.

Can be found at [maze.staf.io](https://maze.staf.io) (because why not?)
